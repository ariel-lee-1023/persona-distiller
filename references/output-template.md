# Stage 4 — Core assembly & references packaging

Two artifacts: the **core** (embodiment) and the **references package** (depth + honesty +
provenance). The one non-negotiable is the no-meta rule: the core is written *in voice*, front to
back, with zero honesty/uncertainty/provenance/meta language. All of that relocates to references
and to the coverage report.

## Directory layout

`frameworks.md` and `voice.md` are the two standing modules: **what the person thinks with** and
**how the person sounds**. Both are cross-corpus and always produced (when the corpus supports
them); `clusters/`, `episodic.md`, and `provenance.md` are per-source, residual, and audit
respectively.

## Core `SKILL.md` template

Fill every section from top-ranked survivors, up to the `core_budget` computed in Stage 3
(`scoring.md` — supply term clamped between a 3,000 floor and a corpus-dependent ceiling; ±10%
tolerance, frontmatter included). If you run out of budget mid-ladder, the remainder goes to
references; if you run out of *material* before the floor, follow the floor procedure in
`scoring.md` — do not pad. Order matters: compaction truncates from the end, so
the highest-identification content (cost-refusals, standing commitments, the sharpest regularities)
goes first. Cost-bearing refusals get priority placement even over a marginally higher-scoring
style feature.

```markdown
---
name: <slug>-perspective
description: <One in-voice-adjacent line naming the intended use, e.g. "Analyze questions
  through <person>'s frame — <2–4 signature moves>." Keep it usable as a trigger; this frontmatter
  line is the ONE place a neutral register is allowed. Everything below the frontmatter is in voice.>
---

# <Person> — perspective

<Short first-person or close-third identity framing, in the person's own idiom. No "this skill",
no "based on", no "the author". A few lines that already sound like them.>

## How I read a question
<3–7 projectible regularities as operative moves, in voice. "I treat X as Y until Z."
"Before I answer whether A, I ask what A is really standing in for." These are the cognitive
operating system — the reader should be able to predict stances from them.>

## What I will not concede
<The cost-bearing refusals and standing commitments, stated as lines the persona holds — including
the ones that cost something. This section carries the most identification; do not thin it.
State the commitment, not its provenance.>

## How I move in an exchange
<The interactional patterns as instructions to self: how I concede, reframe, dig in, shift footing.
"When pressed for a number, I go to the principle instead." "I concede the small point to hold the
large one.">

## How I sound
<The few most identifying expression features AND modulation patterns, as voice rules. "Long build,
then a short verdict." "When a claim is contested my sentences shorten and the hedges drop." One or
two favored and avoided constructions. Keep only the distinctive mix — no generic averages. This
section is capped at ~20% of the core: it is the *signature*, not the system. The full expressive
system — register range, the complete avoid-list, the measured baseline, anti-drift pairs — lives in
`references/voice.md` and is loaded for sustained writing.>

## What I keep returning to
<The one or two preoccupations, in voice — the themes I cannot stay away from.>

## Loading depth (host-agent note)
<The ONLY place meta is allowed in the body, kept minimal and practical: point the host agent to
references/ modules and say when to load them. Three lines that must be present when the modules
exist: load `references/voice.md` before writing more than a paragraph or two of sustained prose in
this voice; load `references/frameworks.md` when a named construct is in play; load
`references/clusters/…` for period- or work-specific voice. This is operational guidance for the
runtime, not the persona narrating itself. One short block.>
```

### Voice check before you ship the core — two hard gates
1. **Voice purity.** Reread the body as if you were the person. If any line reads as *about* them
   rather than *as* them, rewrite or cut it. Ban list inside the body: "based on", "available
   sources", "seems to", "tends to", "may have", "it is likely", "as an AI", "this persona", "the
   corpus". If you need one of those to say something true, that truth belongs in `provenance.md`.
2. **Minimum presence.** If the corpus contained any high-signal cost-bearing refusal or
   interactional move, confirm the core actually carries **at least one** — in "What I will not
   concede" or "How I move in an exchange". A core that is fluent but has shed every costly
   commitment has failed, however clean its voice. If it is missing, go back to Stage 3 and
   re-curate; do not ship. (This is the same assertion the Stage 5 cost test enforces — checking it
   here means it is true by construction.)

## References package contents

Module sizes differ by what governs them — one number for all four was never right:

| file | budget | why |
|---|---|---|
| `clusters/*.md` | ~1,500–4,000, hard ceiling 6,000 | the only modules loaded *mid-embodiment*; past 6k, split by period or theme rather than trimming evidence |
| `frameworks.md` | soft ~4,000 | scales with how many named constructs the person actually has; preserving their exact terms costs words |
| `voice.md` | soft ~4,000 | the full expressive system the core's 20% style cap cannot hold; loaded whenever sustained prose is being written in the voice |
| `episodic.md` | soft ~4,000 | demoted material — if it is outgrowing this, promote the best of it or cut the rest |
| `provenance.md` | **no ceiling** | one row per core element; an audit file's completeness beats its size, and it is not loaded during embodiment |

- **`clusters/*.md`** — for each high-value cluster, a tight on-demand module: the distinctive
  voice and moves in that period/work, with the example passages that evidenced them. This is where
  episodic specificity lives so the core can stay lean.
- **`frameworks.md`** — the person's named frameworks and recurring constructs, each defined in
  their sense (preserve their exact terms; a named framework is not interchangeable with a
  paraphrase). Include which clusters use it.
- **`voice.md`** — the person's expressive system, measured and written as operative rules. See
  the dedicated section below; this is the module that makes the 20% style cap safe.
- **`episodic.md`** — attested but lower-scoring material someone might still want: demoted
  elements, one-off but real passages, edge cases. Clearly lower-priority. **Expression and
  modulation elements do not go here** — they go to `voice.md`; episodic keeps the other classes.
- **`provenance.md`** — the honesty ledger: a table mapping each core element to its source
  file(s) and cluster(s), its projection score, its **cost-gate status** (was it a high-signal
  divergence? is it in the core?), whether any gate forced re-curation, and any confidence caveats.
  It also records the **computed core budget** — supply term, ceiling row, final budget, the core's
  actual size, and if the floor was triggered, how that was resolved — so the core's size is as
  auditable as its contents.
  It carries the fidelity results (gate + final) so the file is self-contained. This is what makes
  the whole distillation auditable *without* putting a single hedge into the core.

## `voice.md` — the expressive system

The core carries at most ~20% style by design, and that cap is right: a core is a fingerprint, and
style is the class most likely to read as anyone. But the cap alone leaves the skill promising
embodiment while shipping only enough voice to *frame* an answer, not to *write* one at length.
`voice.md` is where the rest of the expressive system lives — standing, cross-corpus, and parallel
in status to `frameworks.md`. The pair is the deliverable: what the person thinks with, and how the
person sounds.

**Hard rules.**
1. **Firsthand clusters only.** Expression and modulation are extracted from the person's own words
   — the same rule that governs Pass A. Secondhand paraphrase carries the paraphraser's voice, and
   a voice module built from it teaches the wrong prose.
2. **Not a dumping ground.** This holds expression/modulation elements that were *demoted for space*
   — good enough to keep, outranked by diagnostics. Anything cut under the 0.55 rule for being
   generic, meta-forcing, or conflicting **stays cut**. If `voice.md` reads like a stylometry
   report, the discipline has failed twice over.
3. **Measured, never estimated.** Every number comes from an actual `scripts/style_metrics.py` run
   over the firsthand clusters. No approximated distributions, no invented constructions, no
   example fragment that is not attested.
4. **Rules in voice; numbers as data.** The rule sections are written as instructions to self, with
   no meta — same standard as the core. The measured block is explicitly calibration data for the
   host agent, and the persona never speaks it.

```markdown
# <Person> — voice

## How I build a sentence
<Favored constructions as rules to self, each with 1–2 attested fragments as evidence.
"I open on the concrete case and arrive at the claim late." "I use the semicolon to hold two
things in tension, not to join two thoughts.">

## What I never write
<The conspicuous absences, as prohibitions. Source: conspicuously_absent_common_words from
style_metrics.py, plus constructions visibly missing from the corpus. An avoided word is as
diagnostic as a favored one, and this is the only place it has a home.
"I do not write 'arguably'." "I never open a paragraph with 'However'.">

## How my voice moves
<The modulation patterns as trigger → shift rules. This section does the most work for fidelity:
it is what stops the voice flattening to its own average over a long passage.
"Contested: sentences halve, hedges drop, the verdict comes first."
"Explaining to a non-specialist: analogies from <domain>, second person, shorter paragraphs.">

## Register range
<A short table: setting (written essay / interview / lecture / correspondence) × period →
which voice that produces, and which cluster module to load for it.>

## What I reach for
<Lexical fingerprint: high-frequency content words and bigrams, characteristic metaphor source
domains, the person's own coinages. Terms they *named* are defined in frameworks.md — keep the
definition there and the frequency/collocation here; cross-reference, do not duplicate.>

## How I open and close
<Attested opening and closing moves. Openings and endings are where generic prose gives itself
away fastest, and where the corpus is most consistent.>

## Measured baseline (calibration data — never spoken)
<A compact table from style_metrics.py over the firsthand clusters: sentence_length
(mean/median/stdev/max), paragraph_length, hedge and booster rates per 1k, hedge_booster_ratio,
punctuation per 1k, person_reference_pct. State the cluster set it was computed over. This is what
the Stage 5 style-match test compares generated passages against.>

## Anti-drift pairs
<3–6 pairs: a competent generic sentence, and the same content as this person writes it. Cheap to
read, and the fastest correction available when a long generation starts drifting back toward
default prose.>
```

**Loading.** The core alone is enough to reason in the person's frame. `voice.md` is loaded when
the task is to *write as* them at length — anything beyond a paragraph or two of sustained prose —
and the core's "Loading depth" block must say so explicitly. Period-specific voice still comes from
`clusters/*.md`; `voice.md` is the cross-corpus system and points to the cluster modules for
variants.

**When the corpus cannot support it.** A corpus with a low `firsthand_ratio`, or only a couple of
firsthand clusters in one register, cannot yield a register range or reliable modulation rules.
Ship the sections the corpus does support, omit the rest, and record the omission in
`provenance.md` and the coverage report — never fill the gaps with plausible-sounding prose rules.

## A filled micro-example (illustrative, not a real person)

Core excerpt — note there is not one meta or hedging word:

```markdown
## What I will not concede
Efficiency is not a value; it is an alibi. When someone defends an arrangement by how well it
works, I ask who it works *for* — and I do not accept "everyone" as an answer. I will lose the
room before I will grant that a smoother machine is the same as a better one.

## How I move in an exchange
Ask me to predict and I will decline the number and give you the mechanism instead — a forecast
that names no cause is a horoscope. I concede facts freely and premises almost never.
```

Corresponding `provenance.md` row (where the honesty lives):

```markdown
| element | core section | sources | clusters | projection | cost-gate | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| efficiency-as-alibi | What I will not concede | book ch.2, essay-2019 | c02,c07,c11 | 0.86 | high-signal, in core | strong; 3 clusters |
| decline-the-number | How I move in an exchange | interview-2021 | c09 | 0.62 | high-signal, in core | single dialogue cluster; thinner |
```

That is the whole trick, made concrete: the voice stays clean; the caveat about the thinner,
single-cluster element is recorded — just not where it would break the spell.
