# Stage 3 — Multi-probe curation & deletion

This is where the value is. The job is to score every candidate from `extractions.json` on five
probes, combine them into one identification score, and then **delete aggressively**. Get this
right before you polish anything else.

## The composite

```
identification = 0.30·projectibility
               + 0.25·cost_refusal
               + 0.20·expressive_match
               + 0.15·interactional
               + 0.10·preoccupation
```

Each sub-score is 0–1. The weights are defaults — tunable, but keep the ordering: the two hardest,
most diagnostic probes (projectibility, cost/refusal) together outweigh everything else. This
ordering *is* the correction against the natural bias toward easily-measured surface style. If you
ever find the core filling with tidy style facts, the weighting is doing its job and you should let
it cut them.

## Scoring each probe (0–1 rubrics)

**Projectibility (0.30)** — does it predict held-out stances?
- 1.0 — from this element alone you can correctly infer the person's position on questions they
  never explicitly addressed; confirmed in the Stage 5 projection test.
- 0.5 — recurs and generalizes somewhat, but predictions are shaky or under-tested.
- 0.0 — reproduces a specific known statement only; no reach beyond it.

**Cost / refusal (0.25)** — does it sit on an incentive-vs-characteristic divergence?
- 1.0 — a documented line the person held against their own audience/interest, with both the
  convenient move and the characteristic move attested.
- 0.5 — a standing commitment that recurs but carried little visible cost.
- 0.0 — no divergence; agrees with what anyone in their position would conveniently say.

**Expressive match (0.20)** — alignment with the *measured* style distribution, including variation.
- 1.0 — a distinctive feature or a modulation *pattern* well outside the generic baseline.
- 0.5 — present but only mildly distinctive.
- 0.0 — a bare average indistinguishable from generic prose. (Most raw metrics land here — that is
  correct, and why this probe is capped at 0.20.)

**Interactional visibility (0.15)** — observable as a move in exchange.
- 1.0 — a repeated, recognizable concede/reframe/dig-in/shift-footing pattern across dialogues.
- 0.5 — appears in exchange but inconsistently.
- 0.0 — never observable interactionally (pure monologue artifact).

**Preoccupation / gravitational weight (0.10)** — the theme they keep returning to.
- 1.0 — surfaces across several *unrelated* clusters; the person cannot stay away from it.
- 0.5 — a recurring interest within one domain.
- 0.0 — mentioned once or twice.

## The deletion rule (hard)

After scoring, cut an element if **any** of these is true:

1. Composite **< 0.55**.
2. It introduces **generic language** — phrasing that would fit a thousand people.
3. It **forces meta-commentary** — you cannot include it without the persona narrating itself,
   hedging, or citing sources.
4. It **conflicts with a higher-scoring** core voice feature — keep the stronger one; drop the
   weaker rather than averaging them into a muddle.

Do not smooth, blend, or "partially include" low-value material. A deleted element that was merely
low-scoring (not generic/meta/conflicting) can still be **demoted to references** if it is attested
and someone might want it on demand — but it does not touch the core.

## Elevation & retention (hard) — why weights alone are not enough

The weights tilt toward the diagnostic signals, but ranking purely by composite still lets *volume*
defeat them: a corpus yields dozens of moderate style features and only a handful of cost-refusals,
so a flat top-N sort can fill the core with tidy generic style while the fingerprints spill into
references. The elevation rules below prevent that. They are not optional flavor — they are the
mechanism that makes the whole design work.

**1. Class priority in ranking.** Do not sort survivors by composite alone. Sort by **class first**,
then by composite within class:

```
cost_refusal  ≈  projectible_regularity   >   interactional   >   variation/modulation
                                                            >   preoccupation   >   stable_style
```

**2. Reserved claim.** Cost-bearing refusals, standing commitments, and variation/modulation
patterns get *first claim* on core space. Fill them in before any stable style feature, then fill
remaining budget down the priority ladder.

**3. Style-metric cap.** Pure style averages (stable_style class) may occupy **at most ~20%** of the
core's elements. If you are over the cap, the surplus style features go to **`references/voice.md`**
regardless of their composite — the core is a fingerprint, not a stylometry report. The cap is a
*routing* rule, not a discard rule: everything above it is kept, in the module built to hold it and
loaded whenever sustained prose is written in the voice. Same for surplus modulation patterns.
Elements cut under the 0.55 rule are still cut; `voice.md` takes the demoted, not the deleted.

**4. Sparsity protection.** A high-signal cost-refusal or variation pattern that clears the ≥2-cluster
bar is retained even if it is rarer than, and outscored on the composite by, an abundant style class.
Count never demotes a scarce diagnostic below a plentiful generic one.

**5. Minimum presence.** If the corpus contains *any* high-signal cost-refusal or interactional move,
the core must carry **at least one**. This is asserted again at the Stage 5 presence check; enforce
it here so it is true by construction, not by luck.

Fill the core to the computed budget (next section) under these rules — see `output-template.md`
for the section layout; everything else attested goes to references.

## The core budget is computed, not fixed

A flat cap is the wrong instrument. The core's job is to carry fingerprints, so its size should
track **how much diagnostic material actually survived curation**, bounded by **what the corpus can
honestly support** — not by a constant that a rich corpus under-uses and a thin one invites padding
to reach. Compute the budget after the survivor set is ranked and before you fill it.

**Step 1 — supply term.** Count survivors slated for the core by class (`n_*` are counts of
survivors of that class, before the budget decides how many are actually written):

```
supply = 2,200
       + 250 × min(n_cost_refusal,  6)     # incl. standing commitments
       + 180 × min(n_projectible,   7)
       + 140 × min(n_interactional, 5)
       + 120 × min(n_variation,     4)
```

Preoccupation and stable_style contribute **nothing**. They never earn space; they fill space the
diagnostics have already earned. Saturation is ~6,140 — a corpus that maxes every term.

**Step 2 — corpus ceiling.** From `coverage_map.json`, first matching row wins:

| condition | ceiling |
|---|---|
| `firsthand_ratio` < 0.50 | **4,000** |
| `total_tokens` < 50k **or** `n_clusters` < 4 | **4,000** |
| `total_tokens` < 250k **or** `n_clusters` < 9 | **5,500** |
| otherwise (≥250k tokens, ≥9 clusters, ≥2 periods in `temporal_spread`) | **6,500** |

**Step 3 — clamp.**

```
core_budget = clamp(supply, floor = 3,000, ceiling)
```

Measure against the rendered `SKILL.md` including frontmatter, ±10% tolerance. Record
`core_budget`, its inputs, and which ceiling row applied at the top of `scores.json`.

Worked: a dialogue-rich 180k-token corpus in 11 clusters yielding 3 cost-refusals, 5 regularities,
3 interactional moves, 2 modulation patterns → supply 2,200+750+900+420+240 = **4,510**, ceiling
5,500 → budget **4,510**. The same curation over a 30k-token corpus → ceiling 4,000 → budget
**4,000**, and the two lowest-ranked survivors go to references.

### The floor (3,000) is a diagnostic trigger, never a padding target

If `supply` lands under 3,000, the survivor pool is too thin to embody the person at full scope. Do
these in order — stop as soon as the pool clears:

1. **Re-examine the 0.45–0.55 cut band**, but only for `cost_refusal`, `projectible`,
   `interactional`, and `variation` candidates. The 0.55 threshold is tuned for an abundant pool; a
   thin pool means it was applied to a pool it was not tuned for. The ≥2-cluster evidence bar stays
   hard — re-scoring is not re-labelling.
2. **Check for under-extraction upstream.** A monologic corpus routinely yields `n_interactional`
   = 0; that is a corpus fact, not a curation failure, and Stage 2 will not find what is not there.
   Confirm against `dialogue_ratio` before assuming the pass was lazy.
3. **Ship a reduced-scope core below the floor.** Narrow what the persona claims in the frontmatter
   description, log the shortfall and the computed `supply` in `provenance.md`, and name it in the
   coverage report.

Never top the core up with `stable_style` material to reach the floor. It would breach the 20% cap,
and it is precisely the failure mode this whole design exists to prevent: a core that is fluent,
correctly sized, and reads like anyone.

## Gate before assembly

Scoring does not flow straight into Stage 4. Before assembly, run the **projection gate** and **cost
gate** in `fidelity-tests.md`; a failing projection score means you re-curate (down-weight over-fit
elements, promote better-generalizing ones) or narrow scope and re-score, and a cost-gate miss means
you re-include or elevate the missing divergence. Record both outcomes in the persona's
`provenance.md`, and note any weight change they triggered. Only a set that clears both gates gets
assembled.

## Auto-weighting hooks

- Dialogue-rich corpus (`coverage_map.dialogue_ratio` high) → nudge the interactional weight up
  (e.g. 0.15 → 0.20) and renormalize; monologic corpus → nudge it down toward projectibility.
- Narrow user focus → raise the weight of the requested facet and drop off-focus elements even if
  they score well, since they are out of scope for this persona.
- Record any weight change and why, at the top of the audit log, so the run stays reproducible.

## Audit log (`scores.json`)

Every decision is logged with its scores and a one-line reason, so the whole curation is
inspectable and defensible.

## Two worked examples

**Kept.** A candidate `cost_refusal`: the person repeatedly argues *against* a position their own
readership favors, taking the unpopular side on principle, attested in three clusters, and from it
you can correctly predict their stance on a fresh case. Scores: projectibility 0.9, cost 1.0,
expressive 0.4, interactional 0.8, preoccupation 0.7 → composite **0.80** → **core**, high rank.
This is the kind of element that earns identification.

**Cut.** A candidate `expression`: "uses moderately long sentences, average 22 words." Scores:
projectibility 0.1, cost 0.0, expressive 0.5, interactional 0.0, preoccupation 0.0 → composite
**0.10** → **cut**. Generic and below threshold; a persona built on this reads like anyone. If a
*modulation* version existed ("sentences collapse to clipped fragments the moment a claim is
contested"), that would score far higher on expressive match and interactional and might reach the
core — the pattern individuates where the average does not.
