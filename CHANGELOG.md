## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] — 2026-08-04

Sizing and voice. Two of the skill's constants turned out to be doing less work than they looked
like they were doing. The ~5,000-token core cap never bound — shipped cores land at 2,000–4,600
tokens — and had no lower edge, so it neither restrained a rich distillation nor caught a thin one;
it is now a per-run computation with a floor. And the 20% style cap correctly kept the core a
fingerprint, but a fingerprint is enough to *frame* an answer in someone's voice and not to *write*
one at length, which left the skill promising more embodiment than it shipped; the rest of the
expressive system now ships as `references/voice.md`, a standing module co-equal with
`frameworks.md`.

Major, because two intermediate-artifact schemas gained required fields.

### Changed

- **The core's token budget is now computed per run, not fixed at ~5,000.** The flat cap was the
  wrong instrument in both directions: it was never binding in practice (shipped cores landed at
  2,000–4,600 tokens, so it disciplined nothing), and it had no lower edge at all, so a
  under-curated 2,000-token core passed every check the skill made. The budget is now a **supply
  term** over the diagnostic material that actually survived curation — `2,200 +
  250·min(n_cost_refusal,6) + 180·min(n_projectible,7) + 140·min(n_interactional,5) +
  120·min(n_variation,4)` — clamped between a floor and a corpus-derived ceiling. Preoccupation and
  stable style contribute nothing to supply: they fill space the diagnostics have already earned,
  and letting abundant style buy more room is the exact inversion the skill exists to prevent.
- **Ceilings come from `coverage_map.json`**, first match winning: 4,000 when `firsthand_ratio` <
  0.50 or the corpus is small (< 50k tokens or < 4 clusters), 5,500 mid, 6,500 for a large
  multi-period corpus. A persona built mostly from other people's words does not get to be large.
- **Reference module budgets split by file type**, replacing the single ~800–2,000 range that every
  shipped persona already violated by 2–4×: `clusters/*.md` ~1,500–4,000 with a hard 6,000 ceiling
  (split by period or theme rather than trimming evidence), `frameworks.md` and `episodic.md` soft
  ~4,000, and `provenance.md` uncapped — it is one row per core element and is not loaded during
  embodiment, so completeness beats size.
- `references/pipeline.md`: `firsthand_ratio` is now shown in the `coverage_map.json` example (it
  was only described in `acquisition.md`), and the coverage map's stated jobs include picking the
  core's ceiling row.

### Added

- **`references/voice.md` — a standing expressive-system module, co-equal with `frameworks.md`.**
  The 20% style cap keeps the core a fingerprint, and that is right, but a fingerprint is enough to
  *frame* an answer in someone's voice and not to *write* one at length — so the cap on its own left
  the skill promising more embodiment than it shipped. The rest of the system now has a home: favored
  constructions with attested fragments, the **avoid-list** (words and openings conspicuously missing
  from the corpus — as diagnostic as the favored ones, and until now homeless despite Pass A being
  told to measure them), modulation rules as trigger → shift pairs, register range across settings
  and periods, lexical fingerprint, the `style_metrics.py` measured baseline, and anti-drift pairs
  for long generations. Built from **firsthand clusters only**. The two standing modules are now the
  deliverable pair: what the person thinks with, and how the person sounds.
- **The style cap became a routing rule, not a discard rule.** Surplus expression and modulation
  elements go to `voice.md` rather than being scattered into `episodic.md` or lost; material cut
  under the 0.55 deletion rule stays cut. `voice.md` takes the demoted, never the deleted — otherwise
  it becomes the stylometry report the core was protected from. `episodic.md` no longer holds
  expression/modulation at all.
- **The style-match test now runs the configuration that ships.** Samples are generated under the
  core **plus `voice.md`** — that pair is the sustained-prose configuration — with at least one
  contested prompt and at least one sample long enough to drift (400+ words), since a voice that is
  right for three sentences and generic by the twelfth is exactly what this test exists to catch. A
  new `avoid_list_violations` count is required in `fidelity.json`: cheap, near-binary, and it
  catches drift the distributions blur. Running the core alone is now described as a control, not
  the test.
- **A 3,000-token core floor, defined as a diagnostic trigger rather than a quota.** Landing under
  it means the survivor pool is too thin for a full-scope core, and the response is ordered:
  re-examine the 0.45–0.55 cut band for diagnostic classes only (the 0.55 threshold is tuned for an
  abundant pool), check whether the shortfall is an upstream corpus fact rather than a curation
  failure, and failing both, ship a reduced-scope core with the shortfall logged in `provenance.md`
  and named in the coverage report. Topping the core up with `stable_style` material to reach the
  floor is prohibited — it would breach the 20% style cap and produce exactly the fluent, correctly
  sized, anyone-shaped core the design is built against.
- `provenance.md` now records the computed budget, the ceiling row, the core's actual size, and any
  floor resolution, so the core's *size* is auditable alongside its contents.

### Breaking

- **`fidelity.json` requires `style.avoid_list_violations`** (an integer; record `0` when the corpus
  supported no avoid-list). Existing fidelity records will fail validation until the field is added.
- **`scores.json` requires a new `core_budget` object** (supply, ceiling, ceiling_rule, budget,
  floor_triggered, counts by class; `floor_resolution` when the floor was tripped). Logs written
  before this change will fail schema validation — add the block, or re-derive it from the run's
  coverage map and survivor counts. The ceiling is enumerated to `4000 | 5500 | 6500` so a budget
  cannot quietly exceed what the corpus supports.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-27

Remote corpus acquisition. The corpus path stopped being hardcoded in 1.1.0, but the corpus was
still assumed to be local files already on disk. It can now be a git repository, a file URL, or a
docs site, wiki, or published note collection — with a procedure that separates the person's
material from the container's scaffolding, and classifies whose words each cluster actually
contains.

### Added

- **`references/acquisition.md`** — the corpus-acquisition procedure, run *before* Stage 1 (not a
  sixth stage; the five-stage framing is unchanged). Covers resolving the source type, fetching by
  type, corpus-versus-container separation, attribution classification, source independence, chunking
  for wikis and note collections, honest degradation, and crawl rights.
- **Corpus/container separation with mandatory user confirmation** — a repository or a site is a
  *container*. Everything acquired is inventoried and classified as corpus or scaffolding (READMEs
  describing the collection, build and CI config, templates, navigation and index pages, licence
  files, contributions by anyone other than the subject), and the classification is shown to the user
  for confirmation before Stage 1. Handed a URL, the old behaviour varied by host, and its worst case
  was silent: a fluent persona of the repository's own scaffolding.
- **Attribution classification** — every acquired unit, and every cluster it produces, is labelled
  `firsthand`, `secondhand`, `mixed`, or `unknown`. Most online knowledge bases are secondhand;
  distilling a well-organised set of someone's *notes on* a thinker yields a persona of the
  note-taker's summarising prose.
- **Three hard rules following from attribution** — expression and modulation extraction runs on
  `firsthand` clusters only, and `style_metrics.py` is never run on secondhand text because it
  measures the wrong person's prose; a projectible regularity requires at least one `firsthand`
  cluster, with secondhand clusters able to corroborate but not to carry one alone; and cost-bearing
  refusals or interactional moves sourced only from secondhand material are flagged unverified and
  cannot satisfy the Stage 5 cost/presence assertion.
- **Source-independence collapsing** — the ≥2-cluster corroboration rule assumes clusters are
  independent evidence. Two pages of one knowledge base derived from the same underlying work are
  *one* source and are now collapsed before scoring, so a single source cannot silently satisfy a
  rule designed to require two.
- **Chunking guidance for wikis and note collections** — group short pages by topic or by the
  underlying source work until each cluster can carry evidence, and deduplicate first, since
  repetition inside one knowledge base is not recurrence across clusters and otherwise reads as a
  preoccupation that does not exist.
- **Cluster attribution fields** — `clusters-manifest.schema.json` gains a required `attribution`
  enum plus optional `source_url`, `retrieved` (ISO 8601 date), and `revision` (commit SHA), because
  remote content changes and reproducibility needs the retrieval pinned.
- **Acquisition records on the coverage map** — `coverage-map.schema.json` gains optional `sources`
  (type, location, retrieval date, revision, licence) and `firsthand_ratio`, the number that says how
  much of a persona came from the person rather than from people writing about them.

### Changed

- **`SKILL.md` — Inputs** now names four accepted source types (local path or directory, git
  repository URL, plain file URL, docs site / wiki / note collection) instead of "one or more files,
  or a directory".
- **`SKILL.md` — Host environment** — the *Corpus in* row states that the source may be remote, and
  that network access and `git` are host capabilities to check rather than assume; missing either
  means saying so and asking for the material locally, never reconstructing it from training-data
  recollection of the person.
- **`SKILL.md` — pipeline preamble** establishes that acquisition precedes Stage 1, and the reference
  list points at `references/acquisition.md`.
- **`references/pipeline.md`** — the extraction-routing section now opens by requiring acquisition
  and the confirmed corpus/scaffolding split first, and the `clusters/manifest.json` snippet carries
  `attribution`.
- **`references/schemas/README.md`** — the index rows for the two Stage 1 artifacts point at
  `acquisition.md`, the required `attribution` label joins the list of structurally encoded rules,
  and the firsthand requirement on regularities is recorded among the rules deliberately left
  unencoded, since no schema can follow a cluster id across files.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-27

Host portability + artifact schemas. The skill previously assumed the filesystem layout of one
specific agent host; it now runs anywhere. Intermediate artifacts gain canonical JSON Schemas.

### Added

- **`SKILL.md` — "Host environment" section** — the three host-dependent locations (corpus in, work
  directory, persona out) are now named explicitly and resolved once at the start of a run, instead
  of being hardcoded. States that suggested tools are preferences with fallbacks, and that both
  scripts are standard-library-only under any Python 3.
- **Explicit work-directory creation** — `references/pipeline.md` now instructs the agent to create
  the work directory before Stage 1 and explains why the artifacts must survive the whole run: the
  control flow is a loop, the deletion rule is only defensible with the audit log intact, and the
  coverage report and `provenance.md` are built from those files.
- **`.gitignore`** — blocks the work directory, generated `*-perspective/` personas, stray
  intermediate artifacts, and source-corpus formats (`*.pdf`, `*.epub`, `*.mobi`, `*.azw`,
  `*.docx`, and corpus directories). This last group protects the claim in `NOTICE.md`: a single
  careless `git add -A` on a corpus directory would republish the source works. Shipped schemas are
  explicitly re-included so no JSON rule can shadow them.
- **`references/schemas/`** — JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) for every intermediate artifact the
  pipeline writes, each with a worked example: `clusters-manifest.schema.json`,
  `coverage-map.schema.json`, `extractions.schema.json`, `scores.schema.json`,
  `fidelity.schema.json`, and `passages.schema.json` (the input `holdout_split.py` reads).
  Previously these shapes existed only as illustrative snippets across four reference files,
  two of which carry `//` comments and so do not parse as JSON if copied verbatim.
- **Structurally encoded rules** — the schemas express several of the skill's hard constraints
  rather than only field types: a `regularity` element requires ≥2 corroborating clusters, a
  `cost_refusal` or `interactional` element requires `convenient_move`, a `core` decision requires
  a `rank`, and all probe scores and composites are bounded to 0–1.
- **`references/schemas/README.md`** — artifact-to-stage-to-schema index, and an explicit note on
  the two rules deliberately left unencoded (the 0.55 deletion threshold, which valid `cut` records
  fall below, and weights summing to 1.0, which JSON Schema cannot express).

### Changed

- **Work directory is now relative** — `persona_work/` under the current working directory, or a
  host-provided scratch location, replacing the hardcoded `/home/claude/persona_work/`.
- **Corpus input and persona output locations are resolved from the host** rather than fixed to
  `/mnt/user-data/uploads/` and `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`. Those paths remain documented as one
  host's convention, not as the contract.
- **Extraction routing table restructured into preferred / fallback columns** — every format has a
  named stdlib or common-CLI fallback, so a host lacking a document-reading tool degrades output
  quality and logs it in the coverage report rather than failing the run.

### Fixed

- **`README.md` script usage** — the `holdout_split.py` example passed a corpus directory, which
  the script cannot read; it requires a JSON list of passage IDs or inline `--ids`. Corrected, and
  the `--ids` form added.
- **`SKILL.md` script description** — now states that `holdout_split.py` takes a JSON passage-ID
  list rather than a corpus path.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-23

Initial public release.

### Added

- **`SKILL.md`** — the core skill: a five-stage pipeline (ingest & segment → multi-granularity
  extraction → multi-probe curation & deletion → assemble → fidelity verification) for
  distilling one person's corpus into an embodiment-ready persona skill.
- **Family-resemblance framing** — recognition treated as redundant, overlapping probes rather
  than a clean partition of the person; corroboration across probes is retained rather than
  deduplicated away.
- **Hard-signal prioritisation** — cost-bearing refusals, patterns of variation, and
  interactional moves weighted above easily-counted surface style.
- **Five-probe scoring composite** — projectibility (0.30), cost/refusal signal (0.25),
  expressive match (0.20), interactional visibility (0.15), preoccupation (0.10).
- **Deletion rule** — hard cut below 0.55 composite, plus unconditional cuts for generic
  language, forced meta-commentary, or conflict with a higher-scoring voice feature.
- **Elevation rule** — survivors ranked by class priority before composite, capping pure style
  averages at ~20% of the core so abundant style metrics cannot crowd out sparse fingerprints.
- **Pre-assembly gates** — projection gate and cost gate run *before* Stage 4 and feed back into
  curation as control signals, making the pipeline a loop rather than a straight line.
- **The honesty split** — no disclaimers or meta framing inside the embodiment artifact;
  coverage gaps, citations, and confidence relocated to `references/` and the user-facing
  coverage report.
- **`references/pipeline.md`** — Stage 1 mechanics, extraction routing by file type, coverage
  map schema.
- **`references/extraction.md`** — Stage 2 expression-DNA taxonomy, projectible-regularity
  verification, cost-bearing and interactional catalogue.
- **`references/scoring.md`** — Stage 3 probes in depth, worked scoring examples, deletion rule,
  audit-log format.
- **`references/output-template.md`** — Stage 4 core template and references-package layout,
  with a filled example.
- **`references/fidelity-tests.md`** — Stage 5 projection, cost, and style-match procedures,
  thresholds, and reporting.
- **`scripts/style_metrics.py`** — countable expression features (sentence-length distribution,
  hedge/booster rates, punctuation rhythm, lexical diversity, person-reference ratios, top
  content terms and bigrams). Standard library only.
- **`scripts/holdout_split.py`** — reproducible seeded split of passages into keep/masked sets
  for the held-out projection test.
- **Operating modes** — full distillation (default), analyze-only, and fold-in/update against an
  existing persona.
- **Scope statement** — perspective and thinking-style work only; explicit refusal of deceptive
  impersonation and forged attribution.
